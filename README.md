# Indexer
Given some files, it will add every word it finds in a tree, and will also  
store its total and per file frequency, as well as the sentences in which it  
appeard. You'll then be able to query the program to print the word's information.  

The program will prompt you: "Word: ".  
Enter a word and it will prompt: "Print how many occurrences from each file: "  

Very straight forward, I think.   
  
Compile with make.  
run as:  
./main <path_to_file1> [<path_to_file2> [...]]
